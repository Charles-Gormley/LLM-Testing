**When:** The missile attack occurred just hours after Russia condemned U.S. airstrikes on the Houthis in support of the internationally recognized Yemeni government.

**Why:** The Houthis have been battling the Saudi-led coalition, backed by the United States, since 2015. The conflict has created a humanitarian crisis, with millions of Yemenis facing hunger and displacement. The Houthis' missile attack on the shadow vessel carrying Russian oil is seen as a response to the U.S. airstrikes and an escalation of tensions in the region.

**The Missile Attack:** The Houthis claimed responsibility for the missile attack, saying it targeted a vessel carrying ""Saudi oil."" However, the exact target and the nature of the cargo remain uncertain. Some reports indicate that the missile struck a Panamanian-flagged vessel named ""UAE Falcon,"" while others suggest it missed its intended target.

**Russian Condemnation:** Russia strongly condemned the U.S. airstrikes on the Houthis, calling them a ""gross violation of international law."" Russia has been a vocal critic of the Saudi-led coalition's intervention in Yemen, arguing that it has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis.

**Escalation of Tensions:** The Houthis' missile attack on the shadow vessel carrying Russian oil has further escalated tensions in the region. It raises concerns about the potential for wider conflict involving regional and international powers. The incident underscores the complexity of the Yemeni conflict and the challenges in finding a peaceful resolution.

**International Reaction:** The international community has expressed concern over the Houthis' missile attack and called for restraint from all parties involved. The United Nations Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, urged all parties to ""exercise maximum restraint and to avoid actions that could further escalate the situation.""",small,False

This incident occurred just hours after Russia condemned U.S. airstrikes targeting Houthi positions in Yemen.

**Incident:**

- On January 17, 2023, the Houthis claimed responsibility for firing a cruise missile at a shadow vessel carrying sanctioned Russian oil in the Gulf of Oman. The vessel was reportedly sailing under a Panamanian flag and was targeted while it was anchored off the coast of Oman.


- The attack did not result in any casualties or damage to the vessel. However, it raised concerns about the safety of maritime shipping in the region and the potential for further escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which backs the Houthis.

**U.S. and Russian Responses:**

- The U.S. condemned the attack, calling it a ""dangerous and provocative action"" that threatened freedom of navigation in the region. The U.S. also reiterated its support for the Saudi-led coalition and its commitment to countering Iranian influence in the region.


- Russia condemned the U.S. airstrikes on the Houthis, accusing the U.S. of violating international law and undermining efforts to achieve a political solution to the conflict in Yemen. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and a resumption of peace talks.

On October 11, 2022, the Houthis, a rebel group in Yemen, fired a missile at a shadow vessel carrying sanctioned Russian oil. The incident took place off the coast of Yemen, near the port city of Hodeidah. The vessel was allegedly carrying 2 million barrels of crude oil, which was being smuggled into Yemen in violation of United Nations sanctions.

The Houthis' attack on the shadow vessel was a response to U.S. strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The strikes, which were carried out on October 10, were in retaliation for Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia.

**Russia's Condemnation of U.S. Strikes on the Houthis**

Russia condemned the U.S. strikes on the Houthis, calling them a violation of Yemen's sovereignty. Russia also accused the United States of escalating the conflict in Yemen.

The Russian Foreign Ministry released a statement saying that ""the U.S. airstrikes on Yemen are a gross violation of international law and a blatant act of aggression against a sovereign state.""

**Implications of the Houthi Attack and the Russian Condemnation**

The Houthi attack on the shadow vessel and Russia's condemnation of U.S. strikes have several implications for the conflict in Yemen.

* The attacks are likely to further escalate the conflict between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition that is supporting the Yemeni government.
* The attacks could also lead to increased tensions between the United States and Russia, which are already strained due to the war in Ukraine.
* The attacks could also complicate efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Yemen.

**Conclusion**

The Houthi attack on the shadow vessel and Russia's condemnation of U.S. strikes are significant developments in the conflict in Yemen.
