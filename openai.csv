4. And get this! They’ve done a linguistic high-wire act by not calling it a layoff—you’ve just been 'performance managed' out of a job!

Let's walk down memory lane with the Switch, a console that totally didn't just rehash old games and call it a day. It's been a veritable buffet of nostalgia, cashing in on every franchise with the precision of a pickpocket at a tourist trap. But alas, some beloved IPs like the ever-elusive Star Fox are playing hard to get, probably still sulking over the Wii U's Star Fox Zero that sold about as well as ice to Eskimos.

Earthbound continues to be as present on the Switch as my will to exercise, despite pleas from fans who just want to play Mother 3 without enrolling in a Japanese language course. Celebrating its 30th anniversary with everything but an actual game, the series tantalizes us with the remote possibility of a Switch release, much like Bigfoot does with forest campers.

And Punch-Out!! You'd think a game about boxing would be a shoo-in for the console that brought us Joy-Con swing-fests like Arms, but nope. It might as well have been KO'd by the Switch Lite, which apparently decided that detachable Joy-Cons and motion controls should go the way of the dodo.

Rhythm Heaven? More like Rhythm Nowhere. It seems Nintendo decided that since the Switch can actually handle full-fledged games on the go, there's just no room for a quirky, beat-centric game that you can beat faster than an egg.

Kid Icarus might as well be renamed ""Kid Who?"" The character Pit flapped his way into relevance with a 3DS game, but since then, it's been radio silence. Apparently, reviving him for the Switch would require the gods' intervention, or maybe, just maybe, he'll be resurrected to hawk the next console's features.

Lastly, Dr. Mario is missing in action, probably quarantining or something. With the Switch littered with puzzle games, it's like someone at Nintendo left Dr. Mario on read. Maybe he'll resurface in the next console generation, presumably after finding a cure for sequelitis.

Nintendo, bless their hearts, have been slinging every franchise they can think of at the Switch, turning beloved games into shiny little moneymakers.

Star Fox is seemingly grounded, probably PTSD from that hard crash landing on the Wii U. Maybe fans will be graced with a remedial port or, dare we dream, a battle royale where Star Fox faces 99 other Fox McClouds in a dodgy space shooter.

Punch-Out!! seems to be MIA too. Maybe it took one too many jabs from the realization that not everyone adores waggle controls or has a nostalgic soft spot for Mike Tyson cameos. Good thing documentaries can help us reminisce about the good old days of pixelated boxing.

Then there's Rhythm Heaven, which danced right past the Switch, probably tripping over all the indies flooding the eShop. It's like a once-beloved mixtape tossed aside for a shiny Spotify playlist.

And poor Kid Icarus, soaring back into obscurity after a brief renaissance. The wait for an adrenalizing return is longer than the line for a PS5 during the holidays.

Lastly, let's shed a tear for Dr. Mario, condemned to the epidemic of obscurity while its mobile reincarnation suffers symptoms of microtransaction fever. Because who needs timeless puzzle fun when you can indulge in in-app purchases?

Star Fox has been MIA, and we are so surprised because of course, its stellar performance on the Wii U didn't at all suggest it would be grounded.

And then there’s Earthbound – the Loch Ness Monster of Nintendo games. Fans have been pleading for Mother 3 like it’s the second coming of video game Jesus. But Nintendo is probably just teasing them with anniversary trinkets instead of an actual game release. Such teases!

Punch-Out!! fans, sorry, there's no love for you in the Switch era. Motion controllers are so early 2017, and besides, who needs new games when you can watch speedrunning documentaries and reminisce about the good ol' days?

Rhythm Heaven's absence is a head-scratcher too, because who wouldn't want to tap and swipe along to the beat on their Joy-Cons? It's almost as if indie developers have filled the void with their own rhythm games. But hey, who's counting?

Kid Icarus – Pit's fought his way into our hearts via Super Smash Bros., but his own games? Not so much. We had Uprising, which was okay, but now it seems the angel's wings have been clipped. Better luck next console, Pit!

And then there's the one deep cut that truly matters: Dr. Mario. Without it, how can we possibly solve puzzles in the form of colorful capsules? It's not like the Switch has any other puzzle games... oh wait.

They clearly missed an opportunity to reinvigorate the jabs and uppercuts of yesteryear but chose to leave us with a nostalgic reminiscence video to cry over instead.

Rhythm Heaven, that quirky beat-matching extravaganza, also skipped the Switch soirée, leaving a void where indie games now dance. Nintendo practically went out of its way to prove that it's too cool for its handheld roots, focusing instead on turning its console games into travel-sized snacks.

And Kid Icarus? The once-cold franchise that warmed up with a stellar 3DS title? Hah, it's back on ice, because a Switch appearance would have made too much sense, apparently. But fear not, the next-gen Nintendo console is coming (someday, maybe?), and with it, the dangled carrot of hope for a resurrection.

Earthbound might as well be the sibling that moved overseas and sends a postcard once a decade. Fans are so desperate for Mother 3 they'd probably take a crumpled photocopy at this point. Nintendo teased us with Earthbound Beginnings way back when, and we're still hanging on that cliff. 30th anniversary celebrations are coming, so keep lighting those hope candles, kids.

Move over, Punch-Out!!, because Nintendo clearly has no love for you this time around. Arms stretched out its springy fists early in the Switch's life, leading everyone to think Punch-Out!! would bounce back, but sadly, the bell never rang. The Switch Lite probably smirked in the background, single-handedly knocking out motion-controlled nostalgia.

For all the five Rhythm Heaven fans out there: surprise, you've been ignored too. Indie games got your back, though, and who needs a new title when you can... I guess just remember the good times?

Mixing Greek mythology with flight and shoot 'em up seemed like a winning ticket, but Kid Icarus might just be Icarus himself, flying too close to the sun with Uprising and then... nose-diving into the sea of Forgotten Nintendo Franchises.

And Dr. Mario? Unless you like playing an antiquated puzzle game on your smartphone, it's quarantine time for the good doctor. A plethora of Switch puzzle games means your prescription for nostalgia will remain unfilled.

But hold up, there might be hope around the corner. Nintendo's next console could be the treasure chest waiting to be unlocked, filled with all these lost gems—or maybe just another round of Mario Kart.

Nintendo may or may not be releasing a new console by the end of the year and the internet is abuzz with what's possibly the most predictable rumor in gaming history. Shocker: a successful gaming company might release a new product! But let's not focus on that juicy non-news, instead let's mourn the ""thin"" lineup of upcoming Switch games and wildly speculate that obviously means all Nintendo's developers are secretly toiling away on Switch 2 titles.

Reflecting on the Switch's era, it's just so touching how Nintendo managed to wring every last cent from our pockets by churning out franchise after franchise. It's heartwarming, really. They left no franchise behind, except for the chosen few that were apparently not good enough to make the Switch cut.

Let's pour one out for Star Fox, the series that's been tossed aside like last year's fidget spinners, probably because of its dismal Wii U outing. And Earthbound? Classic Nintendo, always keeping gamers on their toes and hoping for something that's never going to happen—a Mother 3 port. Such teases.

Don't even get me started on Punch-Out!! Poor Little Mac, probably got knocked out by the fact that the Switch Lite doesn't do detachable Joy-Cons. Rhythm Heaven? More like Rhythm Hell, since it seems to have missed the bus entirely. And seriously, who could forget Kid Icarus? Everyone did, until that one game on the 3DS that made us briefly care again.

Lastly, Dr. Mario—because clearly what the world needs now is another Mario spinoff. Thank goodness for the Switch Online NES app for satisfying that insatiable craving for mediocre puzzle action. But hey, let's not be too sad. Maybe, just maybe, Nintendo's next console will revive all these forgotten gems in full 4K glory. Because as we all know, nostalgia is the gift that keeps on giving (and it never hurts the bottom line).

Editors' Note: Remember, this is all purely speculation and wishful thinking. For all we know, Nintendo could just re-release the Virtual Boy and call it a day. Keep dreaming, gamers!",large,False

Nintendo's about as chatty as a mime about it, yet somehow, we're still convinced it might grace us with its presence this year since the 2024 Switch game buffet looks more like a sad office party snack table.

Reflecting on the Switch's life is like flipping through a family album where almost every cousin got at least a questionable haircut, I mean, a game. From Mario to Zelda, to that WarioWare game you bought but never played, Nintendo milked its cash cows till they were practically dairy-free.

And then, of course, we have the audacity to be shocked that some franchises treated the Switch like it had cooties. Star Fox is off gallivanting anywhere but here, probably put off by the Wii U's attempt at CPR gone wrong. Earthbound fans are still clinging to hope for Mother 3 like it's a life raft in the open ocean—good luck with that.

Punch-Out!! missed the boat perhaps because Nintendo decided the Switch Lite users couldn't handle a little arm-flailing. And my goodness, the Rhythm Heaven fans must be out in the cold playing their own sad trombone, wondering why they didn't even get a sympathy card from Nintendo.

Kid Icarus probably flew too close to the sun and decided to take a decade-long nap instead of blessing the Switch, leaving its niche fans dreaming of what could have been. As for Dr. Mario, well, it seems Nintendo got its medical degree from a mobile app instead of giving us the cure for our puzzle itch on the Switch. But hey, at least the NES app gave us a taste, a bit like eating those complimentary mints at a restaurant and calling it dessert.

If we're making wild wishes, maybe the editors should recommend Nintendo revives the Virtual Boy next. It's about as likely as getting all these missing titles before the Switch rides off into the sunset.",large,False

Despite Nintendo being as tight-lipped as a clam, speculations blaze like fire in a dry forest because 2024's game lineup looks as sparse as my high school social calendar.

Let's take a stroll down memory lane and gawk at how Nintendo has slapped every franchise imaginable onto the Switch, churning out games faster than a factory line during the holiday rush. From Animal Crossing to Zany WarioWare, they've milked those cash cows until they're dry as a bone.

But hark, a tragedy unfolds! It seems a few forgotten franchises might miss the Switch bus completely. Let's pour one out for Star Fox, which is avoiding the Switch like it's a black hole after the Wii U's Star Fox Zero face-planted harder than a skateboarder without a helmet.

Then there's the Earthbound series—which is practically Schrödinger's game at this point—existing in a state of will-they-won’t-they port Mother 3 to the Switch. We're stuck celebrating its 30th anniversary with merch instead of actual games. Because nothing says ""anniversary"" like a T-shirt instead of the thing you actually love.

Up next, Punch-Out!! is as likely to hit the Switch as my chances of winning the lottery. Apparently, in the era of the Switch Lite, introducing games like Punch-Out!! that rely on swinging your arms around is about as fashionable as fanny packs.

As for Rhythm Heaven, well, it apparently missed the train to Switch-ville because uplifting little indie games have started squatting in its territory. If you want a quirky rhythm fix, looks like you'll have to get it from the scrappy neighborhood of Indie Town.

And let's have a moment of silence for Kid Icarus—the franchise that returned from the dead for a quick 3DS jaunt before vanishing into the abyss once more. With no signs of extending its wings onto the Switch, we're keeping those hopes on ice, possibly next to Walt Disney's cryogenically frozen head.

Finally, Dr. Mario, everyone's favorite pill-popping puzzle game, has been about as present on the Switch as Waldo in a striped wallpaper factory. Instead, Nintendo decided to prescribe us a mobile game that went over about as well as a screen-door submarine. Maybe on their next console, Nintendo will remember that it's okay to indulge in some good old-fashioned simplicity.

It seems the rumors are swirling like milk in a latte about the next big thing since sliced bread - Nintendo's potentially upcoming Switch 2, possibly arriving by the end of 2024. Of course, Nintendo is tight-lipped, leaving us all to flounder in a sea of speculation because the lineup of Switch games for 2024 looks about as full as my fridge the night before payday.

As we stroll down memory lane, let's raise a glass to the Switch, the little console that could, churning out every possible franchise iteration like a money-printing machine. From Animal Crossing to WarioWare, Nintendo has left no franchise behind... well, except for a few stubborn stragglers.

Let's talk about the awkward family members who didn't show up at the Switch reunion: Star Fox, who seems to have gotten lost in space after the Wii U; Earthbound, a series that is practically a unicorn; Punch-Out!!, which apparently got KO'd by the advent of the Switch Lite; and Rhythm Heaven, the quirky rhythm game series that’s been out of tune with the Switch's offerings.

Don't forget Kid Icarus, woken from its ancient slumber for a hot sec on the 3DS but now probably dozing off again; and lastly, Dr. Mario, who's seemingly been relegated to the realm of handheld nostalgia and mobile misadventures.

So, if you're holding your breath for any of these titles to make a miraculous appearance on the Switch, it might be safer to just watch speedruns and bask in the glory days.

Look, they don't have a bazillion titles slated for the next year, which obviously means that developers must be secretly churning out masterpieces for an unannounced console, right? Because heaven forbid we have a slow gaming year.

Let's take a moment to pour one out for our dear, sweet Switch—a console that brought every IP out of the woodwork, spun it around, patted it on the back, and turned it into a money-printing machine for the Big N. But alas, not every franchise got the royal treatment. Let's talk about the tragic tales of those left in the dust; they're like the forgotten toys at the bottom of the chest.

We've got the Star Fox saga, soaring high in the past but now seemingly grounded and collecting dust because, well, Nintendo had one hiccup with Star Fox Zero and apparently that's it for ol' Fox McCloud. Maybe they'll throw a bone at some point, or maybe they'll just leave it to the fanfic writers to chart new courses in space.

Earthbound fans, oh you optimistic souls. Still lighting the candles and chanting for a Mother 3 release after years of breadcrumbs leading to... well, pretty much nowhere. Goodness gracious, it's the series' 30th anniversary! Get ready for those sweet merch drops because who needs games when you can have collectibles, right?

Punch-Out!! is keeping Duck Hunt company in the ""Nostalgia Only"" corner, since motion-controlled boxing is about as current as VCRs in Nintendo's eyes. Who needs Little Mac when you've got button mashing and joy-stick wiggling in Switch Lite-land?

Our dear Rhythm Heaven, it seems that rhythmic tapping on portable screens is so last-gen. The Switch has bigger fish to fry, so the plucky beats must go on without an official curtain call. And indies are filling the void, because who doesn't love a good underdog story?

As for Kid Icarus, surely most thought of it as a mythological relic until Pit grew wings in Smash Bros. But an actual new game? What an Icarian dream! It's been over a decade since Uprising promised a renaissance that turned out to be more of a one-hit wonder.

And sulking in the corner with a stethoscope is Dr. Mario, whose puzzle adventures have been quarantined to the NES app while his MD was revoked in place of a mobile gig. But in the midst of so many puzzle games on Switch, is anyone doing rounds searching for the doctor?

Bottom line, get your disappointment-ready but hopeful hats strapped on tight for this year, kiddos, because whether or not Nintendo will fill these voids is anyone's guess.

Their unfamiliarity with the protagonist hints either at a spectacular snafu or an office Thanos snap that dusted the entire managerial hierarchy.

2. And then, two HR strangers break the bad news—either someone bungled the pink-slip guest list, or the layoff plague wiped out the managerial pecking order, too. Who needs a familiar face during a career crisis anyway?

3. Those poor HR souls, playing corporate grim reapers with a hit list, having to face the confused mob without a clue. Because explaining reasons is just too mainstream, and a group call ""you're all fired"" party lacks that personal touch of doom.

Rhythm Heaven, the series you never knew you missed until you realized it's not there, got lost in the transition like loose change in the couch cushions. And of course, Kid Icarus might just make its grand return... on the next console, because what better way to sell new tech than resurrecting a series that was practically in cryogenic freeze?

Lastly, there's a tearful ode to Dr. Mario, which – in a sea of puzzle games on the Switch – didn't make the cut because why release a timeless classic when you can, I don't know, not? But don't worry, any day now, Nintendo will surely come to their senses and give us all that sweet, sweet nostalgia in HD remastered glory on whatever the next console is called.

It's been quite the nostalgia trip with the Switch, as Nintendo squeezed every penny out of their fan-favorite franchises, with barely a stone left unturned or a pocket left unpicked. Who could forget those edge-of-your-seat reimaginings of Animal Crossing or the F-Zero experience we never knew we desperately needed but still don't have?

And of course, let's talk about those series that Nintendo seems to have forgotten like that one relative we all conveniently remember only during the holidays. Star Fox? Earthbound? Punch-Out!!? Apparently, all waiting for that magical ""last-second release"" – because nothing says planning like spontaneous game launches.

Earthbound remains the unicorn everyone's chasing, hope eternal with those plans for anniversary merch that totally promise even the faintest glimmer of potential game news. Meanwhile, Punch-Out!! seemingly got knocked out by something called the Switch Lite effect, a new scientific phenomenon that apparently prevents the existence of certain games.

Let's pour one out for the cult classics and the maybes, the Rhythm Heavens that got lost in the shuffle, and the once-lost-now-found Kid Icarus that's now, well, lost again. These are the games that might join us on a new console, because everyone loves waiting a decade or more for a sequel, right?

And as we sit longing for those pure puzzle joys like Dr. Mario, Nintendo dabbles in mobile versions that make us yearn for the simpler, touch-less times.

Let's pour one out for the Switch, a veritable treasure trove that gifted gamers with an embarrassment of riches, from rehashed classics to quirky spinoffs. Thanks, Nintendo, for taking every IP you've ever created and squeezing it for every last drop of nostalgia-fueled revenue. But hey, who's counting the franchises when we've had THIS much fun?

No? Well, there's always the hope they'll get a dazzling revival on Switch 2: Electric Boogaloo.

Rhythm Heaven fans, sorry to break it to you but it seems like your game got lost in Nintendo's couch cushions while they were too busy transforming every other handheld classic into a full-blown console spectacle. Maybe next-gen will have room for these quaint little rhythm games amid all the graphically overcharged titans.

As for Kid Icarus, looks like it's stuck waxing its wings, hoping for a chance to fly high again. I mean, who isn't holding their breath for a franchise that went dormant shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union? And finally, Dr. Mario, ye old puzzle stalwart, got swapped out for mobile gaming mediocrity, because who needs tradition when you can have microtransactions?

And what a riveting surprise that the same titles we've loved, hated, and loved to hate could potentially reappear in some fresh, new-old form on the much anticipated ""Switch 2.""

Star Fox, the beloved space furball squadron, remains AWOL on the Switch. Shocking, isn't it, that after the commercial belly flop on the Wii U, Nintendo might be hesitant to give Fox McCloud another joyride. But hey, maybe they're just holding that ace for the grand Switch finale.

Oh, Earthbound, you tease! Fans just can’t get enough of not playing Mother 3 in English. Yet, we ""might"" see it on the Switch or maybe not—let's keep milking that hope for another 30 years under the guise of anniversary celebrations and “merch drops.”

Punch-Out!! joins the ranks of the Nintendo franchises that live on in the minds and hearts of nostalgic fans, as if nostalgic heart-space earns revenue. Apparently, the Switch Lite killed any dream of motion-controlled, uppercut-throwing shenanigans. But don't worry, you can watch speedruns of the original to relieve your sorrow.

Then we have Rhythm Heaven, confidently riding the bench behind a legion of indie rhythm games because who needs quirky Nintendo beats when you can jam to indie darlings? Poor Rhythm Heaven, a heartbeat away from acknowledgment.

Kid Icarus, the prodigal son of the early Nintendo era, flapped back into our lives for a hot minute on the 3DS, only to ghost us yet again. Fret not; maybe this underdog angel will fly again when Nintendo needs a showstopper for their next-gen gimmicks.

And finally, Dr. Mario, the most thrilling pill-stacking game you never knew you missed. Instead of dropping pills on the Switch, it went viral (ahem) as a mobile game. Because when you think of the heart-pounding world of matching colored capsules, you definitely think mobile phones over gaming consoles.

Now, let's talk about the no-shows, those legendary Nintendo titles playing hard-to-get on the Switch. Star Fox is flying under the radar, which is totally shocking given that everyone just loved Star Fox Zero on the Wii U. No, really, they couldn't get enough...

And Earthbound fans are basically archaeologists now, digging through the layers of time for a glimpse of Mother 3. But hey, for the series' 30th anniversary, Nintendo might drop some mercy in the form of, woah, some merchandise! Hold onto your seats, kids.

Punch-Out!! hasn't thrown its hat into the ring either. Maybe it's the ""Switch Lite effect,"" where motion gaming became as relevant as a VHS tape. But if you're sad, just go watch a documentary about the old games, because nostalgia beats new content, right?

Then there's Rhythm Heaven. Maybe it's gone the way of the dodo because everyone's too busy vibing to full orchestra game soundtracks instead of quirky beats. Plus, Nintendo's probably just too swamped with all those high-quality console titles to remember the little guys.

Kid Icarus flew too close to the sun once, got an incredible 3DS game, and then...radio silence. That's okay, who wanted a fleshed-out game series with a beloved Smash character anyway?

Finally, good old Dr. Mario. Clearly, there's no need for a new iteration when there are a million other puzzle games to play. Plus, who needs a new Dr. Mario when the mobile game experiment went so...well, let's just say it went.

Nintendo has not said a peep, but let's all assume they have a gag order in place because this years' game lineup looks like my fridge after a long vacation – pretty darn empty. Surely, this must mean developers are conspiring in secret backrooms, crafting games for a console we're not even sure exists. As we lovingly stroll down memory lane, praising Nintendo's ability to squeeze every last dime out of their franchises on the Switch, let's lament the unspeakable tragedy of franchises like Star Fox, Earthbound, and Kid Icarus that didn't get to join the cash grab on this generation's console.

Can we talk about Star Fox? Once Nintendo's shining star, now apparently unworthy of a Switch debut, all because of a little oopsie with Star Fox Zero's sales on the Wii U. Earthbound, meanwhile, teases us from the realm of vaporware, its fans stuck in a perpetual state of hoping against hope for a Mother 3 port—because nostalgia sells, folks.

Punch-Out!! and Rhythm Heaven fans, I'm afraid you may have fallen victim to what can only be described as the technological Darwinism brought forth by the Switch Lite — sorry, but your favorite motion-controlled and quick-play gems just didn't fit the bill for Nintendo's evolved gaming ecosystem.

And poor Kid Icarus, you finally spread your wings in 2012 only to be stuffed back into the coop, likely to remain caged until the next big hardware reveal. As for Dr. Mario, he's been relegated to the annals of NES nostalgia and a half-baked mobile game because, let's face it, who needs another puzzle game when we've got Tetris 99?

Now, don’t quote Nintendo on that since they're being as silent as a Luigi side-story plot, but with a game lineup as barren as my fridge at the end of the month, it's elementary deduction, my dear Watson, that they MUST be working on something new.

Let’s pour one out for the Switch. It churned out a library of games that was ostensibly Nintendo itself throwing its entire toy box at us, save for a few absentee toys that must have been lost under the couch or something. Yes, even those niche franchises got their five seconds of fame, but a handful of beloved series have been left swiping left in the console dating scene.

Star Fox, the poor, forgotten middle child of the Nintendo family – perpetually stuck in the attic like some kind of space-based Cinderella – didn’t make the guest list to the Switch party. Apparently, the Wii U’s ""Star Fox Zero"" crash-landed harder than a failed Falcon Punch, so Nintendo might be a tad nervous about letting Fox McCloud back in the pilot seat. Still, hope remains they might dust off old Fox for one last Switch barrel roll.

Moving on to Earthbound: the gaming equivalent of that band you claim to love even though they haven't released an album in decades, and all you really want is a re-release of their classic hit, 'Mother 3'. Celebrating its 30th with a grand party of... merch, it's the best non-video game related hope of seeing the game come to Switch. Better keep praying to the RPG gods, friends.

And then there's Punch-Out!!, which most likely got knocked out of contention by the nifty gadget called the Switch Lite, because who needs joy-cons to play a boxing game, right? You might get better odds placing your bets on King Hippo making weight than on Little Mac making a Switch debut.

As for Rhythm Heaven, ah, bless its beat-driven heart. It got lost in the transition from tangible buttons to touch screens, and now with every indie developer and their mother creating rhythm games, who needs a big N stamp on their syncopated escapades?

Next is Kid Icarus, who flew too close to the sun just the once in 2012 with 'Uprising' and apparently decided that was quite enough adventure for a century or two. Perhaps his wings will unfurl on some future console, or perhaps he’s destined to be a relic of Smash Bros. cameos.

Last but not least, Dr. Mario, the game for those who like their medicine pixelated and their viruses vividly colored. Sure, he can fix up your cold with a red-and-blue capsule on the NES app, but don’t expect a Switch residency anytime soon. With a phone-in-hand spinoff that had all the charm of a flu shot, our poor doctor’s return might just be on indefinite hold.

Brace yourselves for a shocker – the lineup is looking as thin as my patience for these rumors, which obviously means the devs are secretly crafting masterpieces for the new console.

Let’s take a moment to reminisce about the Switch, a console that pretty much turned every franchise into its personal piggy bank. We got the A-listers like Mario and Zelda, but Nintendo didn’t stop there—no, they went full Oprah with it, you get a spinoff, you get a spinoff, everybody gets a spinoff!

But gasp, not every series made the cut. Some were apparently left in the dusty old trophy cabinet of Nintendo’s past. For example, Star Fox didn’t make it to the party, likely because its Wii U title did a majestic belly flop commercially. But hey, Nintendo totally has a chance to pull a rabbit out of its hat at the last second.

Speaking of tricks never pulled out of hats, Earthbound fans are still waiting on the Grand Illusion: the release of Mother 3. Despite Nintendo dropping some oh-so-subtle hints that basically led to nothing, fans have 'great hope' for the 30th anniversary. Hold on to that hope tightly, maybe it'll manifest something in this cold, cruel world.

Punch-Out!! is another no-show, because of course, in a world where we now prefer the comfort of nostalgia over the stress of new titles. Some say the decision not to revive the franchise may be due to the introduction of the Joy-Con-less Switch Lite, which clearly couldn't handle the complexities of a game where you punch things.

And what about that quirky Rhythm Heaven, you ask? Well, it seems to have found itself in the unfortunate position of being a handheld game in a console world, and just couldn't find its rhythm (pun intended).

Kid Icarus had a brief heroic moment with Uprising, but has since sunk back into the abyss. The Switch could have been its redemption... or will the next console be the hero it's holding out for? Perhaps when pigs fly – or in this case, when Pit finally gets his wings back.

Lastly, let's pour one out for Dr. Mario, a puzzling omission (pun again, I'm on a roll here) from the Switch repertoire. Maybe it had to do with that mobile game experiment we'd rather forget, Dr. Mario World.

Surely the suspiciously sparse Switch game lineup for 2024 means that developers are locked away in a dungeon somewhere only allowed to work on upcoming super-secret Switch 2 projects.

Let's reminisce about how the Switch was basically a Nintendo IP museum, showcasing every franchise imaginable. It squeezed every penny out of our wallets with myriad installments, including top-tier hits and the, uh, ""less remembered"" spinoffs. Yet, even this treasure trove somehow forgot a few relics, so let's hope those franchise revival prayers are answered in the eleventh hour.

Cue the dramatic gasp—no Star Fox for Switch? Truly shocking, except for the tiny fact that the last one crashed harder than a barrel rolling Arwing. Might Nintendo muster the courage to revive the series, or will it remain lost in space? Only time (and maybe some desperate fans) will tell.

Earthbound, the series so niche it's become a hipster badge of honor, hasn't seen the light of day on the Switch. Fans just want a sniff of that Mother 3 glory, but at this point, it might just be a tactic to keep them forever longing, wearing their ""Bring Mother 3 to the West"" shirts until the fabric disintegrates.

Punch-Out!! skipped the Switch, possibly a victim of the ""Switch Lite effect"" where motion controls are about as useful as a chocolate fireguard. If your heart aches for some ring action, maybe you can seek solace in speedrun documentaries because that's just as good as a new game, right?

Then there's Rhythm Heaven, the quirky beat-tapper that evidently didn't find its rhythm on the hybrid console. No worries, it's not like indie developers aren't leaping at the chance to fill the void with their own, probably cooler, rhythm games.

Let's not forget Kid Icarus, a series that soared with a single 3DS title then promptly nosedived back into obscurity. Maybe the next Nintendo console will resurrect Pit, or maybe he'll just flap around in Super Smash Bros. purgatory forever.

Finally, a moment of silence for Dr. Mario, the puzzle series that got sidelined on Switch to live out its life as a mobile experiment. Was a new Dr. Mario necessary? No, but it's the principle—it's Mario in a lab coat, and everybody loves a good doctor mascot.

The Switch's game lineup for 2024 is skinnier than a celery stick, leading armchair analysts worldwide to conclude that obviously, all the developers are busy churning out masterpieces for the new console.

As we wax nostalgic over the Switch's glory days, let's pour one out for every franchise that got milked harder than a dairy cow in prime season. Nintendo made sure to spin every property into gold, except for the few oddballs they somehow forgot about. But I'm sure they just slipped through the cracks.

Cue the sounds of silence for Star Fox, the series that Nintendo might have left in the void simply because they got space-shy after the Wii U's less than stellar performance. Surely, the Switch could have been Star Fox's savior, but hey, who needs logical business decisions?

There’s a whole three Earthbound fans left sobbing into their pillows because despite merchandise and vague anniversary events, Nintendo just teases them like a high school crush with zero intentions of going to prom. Looks like Mother 3 might just remain the gaming equivalent of an urban legend.

And then there's Punch-Out!!, seemingly KO’d not by a mean uppercut, but by the sinister “Switch Lite effect”—because who needs nostalgia and potentially fun games when you can have... less?

Rhythm Heaven, another “would be nice” series, got left behind in the dust of Nintendo's leap from low-res handhelds to shiny home consoles. God forbid there's a game that doesn’t require a hundred-hour commitment to be worth the cartridge it's printed on.

Kid Icarus, the once-forgotten child of Nintendo’s family, had a brief resurgence before being sent back to the attic. Now's its chance to gather dust until the Switch’s alleged successor decides it's time for another taste of glory. Or not.

Lastly, condolences to the cult of Dr. Mario enthusiasts. They're left clutching their stethoscopes and nostalgia, as Nintendo opted for a mobile game botch-job instead of blessing the Switch with those Rx-rated puzzle shenanigans. But let's be real—who needed another Mario spinoff when we've been swimming in a sea of them?

So there you have it—unfinished business on the Switch while the clock ticks down to the next big thing. Place your bets or don’t; either way, Nintendo's gonna Nintendo.

We've got rumors that the Switch's successor might appear by the end of the year because, hey, there aren't enough games announced for 2024, so why not jump to conclusions?

Let's stroll down memory lane and appreciate how Nintendo milked every franchise like a prized dairy cow on the Switch, from the Mario-zillas to the Zelda-tons. Yet, somehow, precious series like Star Fox, Earthbound, Punch-Out!!, Rhythm Heaven, Kid Icarus, and the medical marvel Dr. Mario seem to have missed the bus to Switch-ville.

Star Fox is playing hard to get after the Wii U's performance of the game left Nintendo feeling a bit frostbitten. They're likely playing ""will they, won't they"" with a rerelease because nothing says ""confidence"" like hesitance sprinkled with nostalgia.

Ah, Earthbound, the Loch Ness Monster of gaming that teases us with the perpetual possibility of Mother 3 on modern platforms. Nintendo's cryptic anniversary celebrations are our ""best hope"" yet, which basically means don't hold your breath unless you're fond of turning blue.

We all naturally assumed that because Nintendo made a motion-control game once, we'd surely get a brand-spanking-new Punch-Out!! on the Switch. Alas, it seems to have been knocked out by the Switch Lite, which apparently hates movement of any kind. Recommended alternative? Watch speedrun documentaries and live vicariously through the retro glory days.

Rhythm Heaven, Nintendo's answer to toe-tapping madness, remains a whisper in the wind, passed over in favor of full-bodied console experiences. Seems like the days of quirky beats and handheld grooves are just not part of the plan when there are bigger fish to fry—like porting over yet another decades-old game.

And Kid Icarus, that one-hit wonder that flew too close to the sun with its unexpected 3DS revival, which now sits gathering dust in the ""might-have-been-cool-again"" pile. Will it soar on Nintendo's next-gen wings? Only the gaming gods know.

Lastly, Dr. Mario, because clearly what the world loses sleep over is the absence of our mushroom kingdom MD on the Switch. As we drown in a sea of puzzles, the lack of pill-stacking action is, without a doubt, keeping us up at night, pining for the good ol' virus-busting days.

It's almost like we expect a company to cater to every nostalgic whim we have. So, Star Fox has skipped the joyride on the current console – shocking, given how stellar Star Fox Zero did on the Wii U, right? Nintendo must be shaking in their boots at the thought of ignoring that overwhelming demand for space barrel rolls.

Then there's Earthbound, and oh, the tragedy of not seeing Mother 3 outside of Japan. The worldwide Mother 3 craving has been clearly keeping Nintendo's top brass awake at night since 2006, no doubt. And while gamer dreams are crushed under the weight of corporate apathy, the series' 30th anniversary looms. Could this be the year they finally release it? Don't hold your breath, unless you're into self-inflicted blue-face chic.

Punch-Out!! also misses the party? Surely, this is where the line must be drawn. Or wait, could it be that the era of motion-controlled games fizzled out with the Nintendo Switch Lite’s arrival? Heaven forbid we adapt and move on from throwing air punches in our living rooms.

Rhythm Heaven, that niche of niche franchises that would rock a Nintendo Direct, simply never took the stage on the Switch. Imagine how much poorer our lives are without flicking the Joy-Con to a catchy beat on our hybrid consoles.

And who could forget Kid Icarus? After the rip-roaring success of Kid Icarus Uprising on the 3DS, everyone's been feverishly anticipating a follow-up that... hasn't happened. Another shocker, since the series was such a household name, akin to Mario and Zelda, and definitely not collecting dust in Nintendo's IP vault.

Finally, there's poor Dr. Mario, left shivering in the cold as other Mario spinoffs like Mario Maker and Strikers warmly embrace Switch's success. Can the gaming ecosystem sustain itself without prescribing Mario in a white coat and stethoscope? Signs point to yes.

Brace yourselves, Nintendo might actually be holding back on releasing games for the original Switch to prep for the grand sequel no one's confirmed. Shocker!

Reflect on the Switch’s lexicon of games, and prepare to drown in the sea of rehashes and quirky side projects. Every franchise got milked within an inch of its life, with Nintendo squeezing the teats of Mario, Zelda, and even F-Zero. It's a farmer's market, and every cow's been tipped.

Now, prepare your violins for the forgotten franchises. Star Fox, the eternal space adventure, might just be ghosting the Switch because the Wii U's iteration had Nintendo running for the hills. But have no fear, maybe the almighty 99 gods will throw a bone to Fox and friends soon.

Earthbound, or rather the non-existent Mother 3, is the running gag of the Nintendo universe. With the big 3-0 candles on its cake, will Earthbound fans finally get their wish, or will Nintendo continue its epic game of keepaway? At this point, the candles might burn out.

Punch-Out!! fans are left shadow boxing, their nostalgia unslaked, all thanks to the apparent Switch Lite effect—because who needs motion controls when you can press buttons? And if you're blue about it, why not watch a lengthy documentary on speedruns instead of playing the actual game?

Rhythm Heaven may be singing the blues, too. Got lost in the shuffle when Nintendo decided that quality gaming shouldn't fit in your pocket anymore, because who wants a quick musical fix when you can lug around Skyrim?

Kid Icarus, the underdog that could, soared high in 2012 only to get its wings clipped. ""What's that, Pit? You want a new game?"" said Nintendo, patting its successful franchises on the back. Maybe the next hardware will give Pit his second wind – or maybe not.

And finally, Dr. Mario, the series that gets a diagnosis of ""irrelevant"" since it's MIA on the Switch. But who really needs another match-three game when you have a cornucopia of indies, right? Sorry, doc, but it looks like the prescription is a no-go this gen.

Let's pour one out for the Switch—a console that supposedly turned every Nintendo IP into a veritable gold mine, despite some series just being repackaged blasts from the past or quirky side projects. It's almost as if Nintendo wouldn't dare overlook any chance to monetize nostalgia.

Astoundingly, some franchises have yet to make their grand entrance onto the Switch stage. Star Fox apparently missed the memo, probably because Star Fox Zero flopped harder than a Magikarp out of water. Yet, we can still delude ourselves into thinking Nintendo might just pull a rabbit out of their intergalactic hat at the last second.

Then there's Earthbound, the underdog RPG series that's more like a ""missing dog"" at this point. Fans are not so much begging for a new game as they are for the chance to relive their childhood through a port of Mother 3—a carrot Nintendo has dangled since pre-Switch times—surely as a cruel joke.

Punch-Out!!, alongside Duck Hunt, has been left in the dust, probably victim to what's been dubbed the ""Switch Lite Effect,"" which conveniently forgets motion controls and thus, any chance for these retro revivals. And if you're sad about it, there's a speedrun documentary you can cry to instead of playing the actual game.

Rhythm Heaven is also hiding somewhere, undoubtedly due to the Switch's identity crisis between being a home console and a handheld. Seems like there's no room for a simple rhythm game that you can blow through in a day when there are more epic quests to embark on.

Kid Icarus might as well be a myth at this point, even if Kid Icarus Uprising did give fans false hope for a future that never came. Maybe Nintendo's saving it for the next hardware release, right when we'll be ready to forgive and forget.

Lastly, there's Dr. Mario, the puzzle game series that somehow didn't make the leap to the Switch, probably killed off by its own mutated mobile game variant. But hey, let's just cling to the dream that maybe, just maybe, Nintendo will resurrect these forgotten franchises on whatever fancy hardware they've got cooking up next.

The Nintendo Switch, which apparently has been everybody's go-to gaming buddy since the dawn of time, might see its younger, cooler sibling by the end of the year. Nintendo hasn't confirmed anything about Switch 2.0 because they love to keep us in suspense, eagerly watching a ""thin"" game lineup for 2024 and dreaming of all the unannounced games developers are totally, maybe, probably working on.

As we walk down memory lane, tears streaming down our faces, we remember all the games the Switch has blessed us with—Mario, Zelda, an endless parade of rereleases, and spinoffs. Every franchise got a chance to print money for Nintendo, except for those few misfits that somehow escaped the Switch's gravitational pull.

The most egregious ghost at the feast? Star Fox. The series practically screams ""use me for nostalgia-fueled profit!"" And yet, Nintendo's glaringly leaving it wallflower, despite the Switch's magical power to turn even the dullest franchise into a glittering star. Of course, they're just teasing us, waiting for the perfect moment to play their Star Fox card—or maybe they're just going to chuck it in the ""too hard"" basket along with the F-Zero 99.

And let's not forget Earthbound, the series with the most elusive third installment, Mother 3. Nintendo teases us endlessly because they enjoy watching us beg for ports like hungry street cats. Maybe the big anniversary blowout will include a game release, or, you know, just some branded dish towels.

Punch-Out!! is another one we've all vaguely remembered fondly but have come to accept will live on only in documentaries and the hearts of speedrunning aficionados. Apparently, the Switch Lite killed any hope of a new title there—Nintendo can't possibly expect us to play games without wiggling our wrists around wildly, right?

Rhythm Heaven, Pushmo, and other ""short bus ride worthy"" games got lost because the Switch is too busy being a chameleon and couldn't decide if it was a console or a handheld. So, no tapping to the beat on your Switch—go find an indie game for that or, better yet, just hum to yourself.

Now, let's pour one out for Kid Icarus, the game everyone forgot they wanted back until Pit flew into Super Smash Bros. and dazzled us with his wings. Kid Icarus Uprising gave us a glimmer of hope, but it's been a cold, dark decade without a sequel. Looks like it might stay that way unless Nintendo needs a pretty tech demo for its next console.

Finally, there's Dr. Mario—the lonely puzzle game sitting in the corner while the cool kids like Mario Maker and Strikers have all the fun. Dr. Mario is just chilling on the NES app, comforting himself with the thought that a mobile game sorta counts. Who needs a new Dr. Mario when there's a plethora of puzzle games out there?

First off, Star Fox is apparently playing hard to get, having completely ghosted the Switch. Perhaps that's because Star Fox Zero crash-landed on the Wii U and Nintendo is still nursing a broken heart. But hope springs eternal for an F-Zero 99 miracle to happen, because that's how we fix things now.

Moving on to Earthbound, which has become the gaming equivalent of 'waiting for Godot' – fans are just dying for a port of Mother 3. But instead of delivering, Nintendo is teasing them with merchandise and anniversaries. Who needs actual games when you've got themed t-shirts, am I right?

Punch-Out!! fans are probably getting a little antsy too, but let's face it, it was sent to the nostalgia corner along with Duck Hunt. Instead of a new Punch-Out!!, Nintendo gave us Arms because apparently, we needed more wacky boxing in our lives. And due to what I've now dubbed the 'Switch Lite effect,' motion-controlled dreams were dashed for good old-fashioned button mashing.

Then there’s Rhythm Heaven, which, surprise surprise, hasn't made an appearance on Switch despite its rich history of being on practically every Nintendo console. It seems the whacky rhythm series got left behind while Nintendo busied itself bridging the gap between handhelds and home consoles – I guess quick, fun games just don’t make the cut anymore.

And poor Kid Icarus – once a forgotten cousin in the Nintendo family – made a stunning return only to be forgotten again. After Kid Icarus Uprising on the 3DS, fans were likely thinking, “This is it! Pit's big comeback!” Yet here we are, with not even a hint of a new game on the horizon. Maybe next-gen will be kinder to our winged hero?

Lastly, let's talk about Dr. Mario, because nothing screams ""Nintendo"" like plumbing-turned-medicine. Alas, it's been relegated to the NES online app and a questionable mobile spin-off. I guess too many fabulous puzzles on the Switch mean there's just no room at the inn for our pill-popping pal.

Speaking of games, remember when Nintendo rolled out games for basically every franchise it's ever had, like throwing a handful of spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks? Because, you know, creativity is hard, but repackaging nostalgia is like printing money.

Anyway, let’s pour one out for Star Fox, the beloved franchise that Nintendo seems to have accidentally forgotten while counting its cash. I guess after their Wii U attempt bombed harder than my attempt at vegan cooking, they got a tad shy.

And can we talk about Earthbound? The elusive Mother 3 is basically the gaming equivalent of Bigfoot—often rumored, never truly sighted. Nintendo's stringing fans along better than a season of ""The Bachelor.""

How about that Punch-Out!! franchise that didn't make it to this Nintendo cycle? It's as forgotten as the time I tried to diet, but at least it's in good company with the likes of Duck Hunt, a game about as relevant today as floppy disks.

Oh, and Rhythm Heaven—bet you forgot that one existed, huh? Nintendo did too, apparently. It seems that in the move to consolidating handheld and console gaming, they dropped a few bits and bobs along the way like grandma's false teeth.

And let's not forget Kid Icarus. That game that was pretty much ancient history until Super Smash Bros. Brawl did its CPR routine on it. After Nintendo finally gave it some love with Uprising, they must have thought one miracle every thirty years was enough.

Lastly, Dr. Mario didn't make the Switch cut, either. Because why would we need a puzzle game on a portable system? That would make too much sense and wouldn't at all fill the gripping absence of matching colored pills on my daily commute.

So, as the editors eagerly suggest more games that missed the Switch train, let's not hold our breath—unless you like passing out. Instead, prepare your wallet for the next Nintendo nostalgia ride. Choo-choo!",large,False

Brace yourselves, Nintendo fans, you might have to start learning a whole new set of button placements by the end of 2024... or, you know, maybe not.

And let's pour one out for the Switch, a veritable cornucopia of gaming goodness that's taken us on adventures from stomping Goombas in never-ending Mario sagas to fishing and paying off mortgage debts to a raccoon in Animal Crossing. But alas, some franchises have been left out in the cold, like a Star Fox flight academy during a space blizzard.

Star Fox, that epic of anthropomorphic space combat, has dodged the Switch faster than a barrel roll dodging laser fire. It must have been that Wii U's Star Fox Zero left Nintendo feeling like they'd accidentally hit the self-destruct button instead of the boost.

Then there's Earthbound, or should we say, the consistently Earthbound-to-never-happening-on-the-Switch saga? Fans desperate for Mother 3 might as well be wishing on a falling star because the closest thing to a release we've seen is some anniversary merch. Get your tissues ready for the 30th anniversary, folks—it's the hope that'll get you.

We've got Punch-Out!!, which is basically now in the Retro Hall-of-Fame, only playable through teary-eyed, nostalgia-fueled memories. Arms came out swinging to take its place, with Nintendo giving us the old ""look over there!"" distraction tactic.

Rhythm Heaven, because who needs a quirky beat-matching game when you have ten million indies stepping up to fill that void? And sorry, Kid Icarus fans, that winged wonder of a hero seems to be trapped in the underworld of forgotten IP, with a Switch appearance feeling as likely as a triple-jump in a first-person shooter.

Finally, Dr. Mario apparently got his medical license revoked or something because all we got was a mobile game that played like someone tried to perform surgery with a sledgehammer. Instead of a solid, virus-busting Switch title, we're stuck with the nostalgia of the good old pill-dropping days on the NES.

So there you have it, the biggest Nintendo series playing hide-and-seek with the Switch. Who knows what the future holds, but if history tells us anything, we should keep expectations low and our sarcasm high. Editors, keep those ""evocative"" recommendations coming.",large,False

Get ready to toss your old dusty Switch aside because apparently, its upcoming successor is going to pop out magically by the end of the year. And shocker, the Switch's current game lineup for 2024 is as beefy as a vegan barbeque, hence the internet sleuths are theorizing developers are busy crafting games for the mythical Switch 2.

Reflecting on the Switch’s tenure is like strolling through a Nintendo-themed flea market. Almost every imaginable franchise, including the forgotten ones you never actually missed, got its 15 minutes of fame on the console. But hey, let's pour one out for our homies Star Fox, Earthbound, and the other dusty artifacts that never made the jump to Switch-ville.

Star Fox, the bravest fox in space since… forever, seemingly got ghosted by Nintendo, probably because its last game crashed harder than a digital asteroid. But fear not, Nintendo might grudgingly give it a second chance on the Switch - or maybe just catapult it straight into the sequel console.

And then there's Earthbound, enjoying its status as the poster child for false hope. Fans aren't yearning for new adventures; they just want to relive the old ones like the gaming equivalent of that uncle who won't stop talking about his high school football days. Maybe Nintendo will throw a bone for its 30th birthday, or maybe not, keeping the meme alive!

Punch-Out!! fans, apparently your nostalgia isn't profitable enough for a Switch outing, probably because Nintendo decided that Joy-Con waggling isn’t in vogue after unleashing the Switch Lite on the world. If you’re really hurting for some Punch-Out!! love, go watch a documentary on speedruns, because that's just as good as playing, right?

Rhythm Heaven's absence is notable, but hey, when you've got indie games to carry on your legacy, that's just as satisfying! Clearly, Nintendo’s too busy making games for actual grown-ups to bother with those whimsical beat-based shenanigans anymore.

And who could forget Kid Icarus, the little winged dude who soared into our hearts and then promptly disappeared again? If you were holding your breath for a new Switch iteration, you might want to start breathing again. Nintendo's busy plotting its next tech push, and Kid Icarus is probably not invited to the party.

Last but not least, Dr. Mario, because everyone is absolutely dying for another Dr. Mario game. I mean, who wouldn't want to cure viruses in a game when you're trying to escape the reality of a pandemic? Nintendo opted for a mobile game instead, probably thinking that everyone's just clamoring for more touch-and-drag action.

Editors, brace yourselves, because this is the part where we pretend to be amazed that Nintendo, that small, obscure gaming company, might do something unpredictable like release a new console out of the blue. Stay tuned, or don't – it's not like there’ll be any surprises either way.",large,False
89,1705103027.2686603,34.81200289726257,openai,gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct,"Oh boy, strap in for a tale as old as time—Nintendo not officially announcing new consoles while everyone speculates that they must be right around the corner because, you know, we haven't had a new Zelda game in a hot minute. It's 2024, and the rumor mill is churning out whispers of the mythical Switch 2, because apparently, a sparse game lineup for the current year is irrefutable proof of new hardware. Who could argue with that logic?

As we stroll down memory lane with the Switch, let's ignore the fact that literally every Nintendo franchise has been milked for all its worth this generation, either with sequels, spin-offs, or the ever-popular re-release of the same game for the umpteenth time. Indeed, Nintendo has cultivated a cash garden, watching franchises bloom into dollar bills.

But wait, hold the phone, there are a few poor, neglected souls that haven't made the Switch (pun intended). Star Fox seems to be lost in space, with zero chance of landing on the Switch thanks to the Wii U’s version crashing and burning. Nintendo's probably playing 4D chess, though, and is simply waiting to surprise us all with a last-minute revival, or maybe they'll just toss it into the pile of forgotten 99 installments.

Next up, Earthbound fans continue their decades-long tradition of setting themselves up for disappointment, begging for a Mother 3 port. With an anniversary that promises everything but actual games, fans cling to their pixelated dreams while Nintendo doles out commemorative keychains and themed t-shirts.

Punch-Out!! is likely knocked out of the running thanks to Nintendo's infatuation with newer, shinier motion-controlled boxing games. But why enjoy a new experience when you can spend two hours reliving the glory days with a detailed documentary on speedrunning the Mike Tyson iteration from the '80s?

Rhythm Heaven, that plucky little franchise, seems to have missed a beat. Maybe it's too busy getting lost between the couch cushions of Nintendo's hybrid gaming empire to grace us with its presence on the Switch. Its absence is certainly a rhythm crime in a world where quirky indie games dare to fill the void.

Kid Icarus, that one series that's more of a trivia answer than an ongoing concern, remains grounded. Sure, it took flight with a 3DS game once, but it's more likely to be spotted on the side of a milk carton than on the Switch at this point.

And finally, the argument for Dr. Mario's inclusion is more a personal plea than a public outcry. Since when did we need more than the NES app and a mobile attempt to satisfy our pill-popping puzzles? Dr. Mario's absence is the cherry on top of a sundae of unrealized potential, teasing what could have been on the Switch but probably won't—unless the unannounced Switch 2 comes to save the day.Editors, you tease with the phrase ""Editors' Recommendations,"" but who needs actual advice when there's a sea of could-have-beens to wade through?",large,False
