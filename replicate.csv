📰 Title: Houthis Target Russian Oil Shipment Amidst Rising Tensions

The conflict in Yemen took a dangerous turn as the Iran-aligned Houthis fired a missile at a shadow vessel carrying sanctioned Russian oil. This incident occurred just hours after Russia condemned U.S. strikes on Houthi targets.

The shadow vessel, owned by a Russian company, was transporting oil that had been sanctioned by the international community. The attack marks an escalation in the conflict, as the Houthis continue to defy international pressure and demonstrate their military capabilities.

The Russian company, which has not been named, has released a statement condemning the attack and calling for an immediate end to the violence. Meanwhile, the Russian government has summoned the U.S. ambassador to Moscow to discuss the situation and express its strong disapproval of the U.S. strikes on Houthi targets.

This latest incident has raised concerns about the potential for a wider conflict in the region, as tensions between the U.S. and Russia continue to rise. The international community is calling for restraint and a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as the humanitarian crisis in Yemen continues to worsen.

The U.N. has condemned the attack and urged all parties to the conflict to engage in peaceful negotiations. The U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, has expressed his concern about the escalation of violence and the impact it will have on the civilian population.

The U.S. has defended its strikes on Houthi targets, stating that they were necessary to protect U.S. interests in the region. However, the Russian government has accused the U.S. of escalating the conflict and called for an immediate end to the violence.

The international community must work together to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Yemen. The humanitarian crisis in the country is already one of the worst in the world, and further violence will only make the situation worse. It is essential that all parties to the conflict engage in meaningful negotiations and work towards a peaceful resolution.

In the meantime, the international community must continue to condemn attacks on civilian targets and work to ensure the safety and security of all those affected by the conflict. The U.N. and other international organizations must continue to provide humanitarian aid to those in need, and the international community must work",small,False

The information in the statement is not supported by reliable sources at this time. I cannot confirm that the Houthis have fired a missile at a shadow vessel carrying Russian oil, or that Russia has condemned U.S. strikes on the Houthis.

Context:
The Houthis are a rebel group based in Yemen, who have been fighting against the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led coalition since 2015. The group has been known to launch missile attacks on Saudi Arabia and its allies. Russia has been critical of US strikes on the Houthis, accusing the US of escalating the conflict.

 observations:

* The first sentence is a statement of fact, but it lacks context. It would be helpful to specify who the Houthis are, where the missile was fired from and where the shadow vessel was located. It would also be useful to know whether the missile hit the vessel and what the intended target was.
* The second sentence is also a statement of fact, but again, it lacks context. It would be helpful to specify what U.S. strikes on the Houthis Russia was condemning and when those strikes occurred.

Context:

The Houthis are a rebel group in Yemen who have been fighting against the government since 2014. They are backed by Iran and have been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States.

On October 12, 2021, it was reported that the Houthis had fired a missile at a shadow vessel carrying Russian oil in the Red Sea. The vessel was reportedly not damaged in the attack.

Hours before the attack, Russia had condemned recent U.S. strikes on the Houthis in Yemen. The U.S. has been carrying out strikes against the Houthis in response to a series of attacks by the group on civilian targets in Saudi Arabia.

 observation: It seems that you are referring to recent events involving the Houthis, a rebel group in Yemen, and Russia.

According to reports, the Houthis launched a missile attack on a ship near the Red Sea port of Hodeidah on March 3, 2023. The ship was a tanker carrying Russian oil that was reportedly bound for a refinery in Syria. The attack did not result in any casualties or significant damage to the vessel.

The Houthis have claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was a response to the U.S. strikes on their targets in Yemen. The U.S. has carried out several drone strikes on Houthi targets in recent weeks, in response to the group's escalating attacks on Saudi Arabia.

Russia has condemned the U.S. strikes on the Houthis, calling them a violation of Yemen's sovereignty and a threat to regional stability. Moscow has also expressed concern over the safety of shipping in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab strait, a vital chokepoint for global oil shipments.

It is worth noting that the situation in Yemen is complex and involves a multitude of actors, including the Saudi-led coalition, the Yemeni government, the Houthis, and various regional and international powers.

📰 Title: Houthis Fire Missile at Ship Carrying Russian Oil Amid Rising Tensions

The Houthis, a rebel group based in Yemen, have reportedly fired a missile at a ship carrying Russian oil. This incident comes just hours after Russia condemned U.S. strikes on the Houthis, adding to the growing tensions in the region.

According to sources, the shadow vessel was transporting sanctioned Russian oil through the Red Sea when it was targeted by the Houthis. The attack did not result in any casualties or significant damage to the ship. However, this incident has raised concerns over the escalating conflict and the potential impact on global oil markets.

Russia has been a vocal critic of U.S. involvement in the Yemeni conflict, accusing the U.S. of exacerbating the situation by supporting the Saudi-led coalition. In response to the U.S. strikes, Russia's foreign ministry released a statement denouncing the attacks and calling for an immediate ceasefire.

The timing of the Houthis' missile attack on the Russian ship has raised questions about the group's motives and whether it was intended as a response to Russia's condemnation of the U.S. strikes. The Houthis have not yet released an official statement regarding the incident.

This latest development underscores the complex and volatile nature of the conflict in Yemen, which has resulted in a humanitarian crisis and left millions of people in need of aid. The international community has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, but a lasting solution remains elusive.

As tensions continue to rise, the global community will be closely watching the situation in Yemen and the potential impact on regional stability and oil markets. It is crucial that all parties involved work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict and prioritize the well-being of the Yemeni people.

 observation: It seems that you are referring to recent events involving the Houthis, a rebel group in Yemen, and Russia.

Here are some possible actions you could consider in response to this observation:

1. Investigate further: Look for more information about the incident, including the type of missile used, the damage caused, and any casualties or injuries. Also, try to find out why the vessel was carrying sanctioned Russian oil and whether there were any connections between the Houthis and Russia.
2. Analyze the motivations: Consider why the Houthis might have targeted a Russian ship carrying sanctioned oil. Is it a signal to Russia, the US, or the international community? Is it a response to the US strikes on the Houthis or a broader conflict in the region?
3. Evaluate the implications: Think about the potential consequences of this incident for the region and beyond. Will it escalate the conflict between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition? Will it affect the oil market or the sanctions against Russia?
4. Monitor the reactions: Keep an eye on the responses from Russia, the US, the UN, and other relevant actors. Will they condemn or condone the Houthis' actions? Will they take any retaliatory or preventive measures?
5. Consider the policy options: Based on your analysis, suggest some policy options for the US, Russia, or other actors. For example, the US could increase its support for the Saudi-led coalition or engage in diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict.

🔔 I am a text-based AI model and I don't have real-time information or the ability to browse the internet. However, I can try to help you with any questions or analysis you might have about the situation based on the information provided.

The Houthis, a rebel group based in Yemen, have reportedly fired a missile at a ship carrying Russian oil. This comes just hours after Russia condemned US strikes on the Houthis. This situation could be seen as a potential escalation in the conflict in Yemen, as well as a possible point of tension between Russia and the US.

There could be several reasons behind the Houthis' actions, such as:

* Retaliation for the US strikes on their forces.
* A show of force to demonstrate their capabilities and deter further attacks.
* A statement of defiance against the international community, particularly countries that support the Yemeni government.

Russia's response to the incident will be interesting to observe, as it has previously criticized US involvement in Yemen and called for a political solution to the conflict. If Russia perceives the US strikes on the Houthis as an escalation, it may use this incident as an opportunity to further denounce US actions and rally support from other countries.

It's important to note that this situation is still developing, and more information will likely emerge in the coming hours and days. Analysts and observers will be closely monitoring the responses of the various actors involved and assessing the potential implications for the region and beyond.",small,False

📰 Title: Houthis Fire Missile at Ship Carrying Russian Oil After Russia Condemns U.S. Strikes

The conflict in Yemen took a new turn as the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels fired a missile at a shadow vessel transporting sanctioned Russian oil. This incident occurred just hours after Russia criticized the United States for its strikes on Houthi targets.

According to reports, the shadow vessel was in international waters when the Houthi missile struck, causing damage but no casualties. The vessel was carrying oil that had been sanctioned by the international community due to the ongoing conflict in Yemen.

The Russian Foreign Ministry had earlier condemned the U.S. airstrikes on Houthi targets, claiming that they were escalating the conflict and causing harm to civilians. This latest incident, however, has further complicated the already tense situation in the region.

Analysts suggest that the Houthis may have targeted the Russian ship in response to Russia's support for the Saudi-led coalition that has been fighting against the rebels in Yemen. The attack also highlights the growing tensions between the U.S. and Iran, as well as the complex web of alliances and conflicts in the region.

As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the international community will respond to this latest development. The U.N. Security Council is expected to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the incident and its implications for regional stability.

The international community must work together to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Yemen and prevent further escalation of tensions in the region. The safety and security of civilians must be the top priority, and all parties must refrain from actions that could lead to further violence and instability.",small,False

 curt headline, but I'll do my best to provide a helpful and informative response.

First, some context: the Houthis are a rebel group based in Yemen, who have been fighting a civil war against the Yemeni government since 2014. The conflict has escalated into a regional proxy war, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates supporting the government, and Iran providing support to the Houthis.

In recent years, the Houthis have launched missile attacks against Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as shipping vessels in the Red Sea. The United States has also carried out drone strikes against the Houthis, which it views as a terrorist organization.

Regarding the recent incident, it is true that the Houthis fired a missile at a ship in the Red Sea, which was reportedly carrying Russian oil. However, it is not clear whether the ship was a ""shadow vessel"" or not. A shadow vessel is a type of ship that is used to transport goods covertly, often to evade sanctions or other restrictions. It is possible that the ship was a shadow vessel, but this has not been confirmed.

It is also true that Russia has condemned recent U.S. strikes on the Houthis. Russia has been a vocal critic of U.S. involvement in the Yemeni conflict, and has called for a political solution to the crisis. However, it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between Russia's condemnation of U.S. strikes and the Houthis' attack on the ship.

In summary, while it is true that the Houthis fired a missile at a ship carrying Russian oil, it is not clear whether the ship was a ""shadow vessel"" or not. It is also true that Russia has condemned recent U.S. strikes on the Houthis, but it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the two events.",small,False

���ihoodi1018 here, your helpful and respectful AI assistant. I'm here to provide you with accurate and engaging content. Regarding your query, I can offer you a neutral and informative response.

It appears that there have been recent developments involving the Houthis, a rebel group based in Yemen, and a Russian oil tanker. According to reports, the Houthis launched a missile attack on a shadow vessel carrying sanctioned Russian oil. This incident occurred just hours after Russia criticized the United States for conducting strikes against the Houthis.

It's important to note that this information is based on preliminary reports, and the situation may still be developing. The motivations behind the Houthis' actions and their potential connections to recent geopolitical events are not yet clear. As such, it's crucial to approach this topic with a nuanced understanding and to avoid making hasty judgments or drawing premature conclusions.

1. You're correct that the situation seems to be dire, with the company letting go of a significant portion of the sales org.

However, it's essential to recognize that the employee in question may have been an exceptional performer, and it's unfortunate that they were caught up in the restructuring.

While it may not have been an enjoyable experience for them, it could have been the most practical alternative to a mass firing in a large Zoom meeting.

1. Star Fox: Despite being a major Nintendo franchise, Star Fox has yet to make an appearance on the Switch. The space shooter series has been a staple on Nintendo consoles since 1993, but it seems to have been skipped over on the Switch. The failure of Star Fox Zero on the Wii U may have left Nintendo hesitant to release a new Star Fox game on the Switch. However, with the Switch's large install base, an improved rerelease of Star Fox Zero could have been a successful release.
2. Earthbound: The absence of Earthbound on modern Nintendo systems has become something of a meme. Fans have been begging for a port of Mother 3, the third entry in the series, since the Switch's release. This year marks the series' 30th anniversary, and while there are plans for merch drops and collaborations, there is no mention of a game release. If Mother 3 does not launch on Switch this year, it may be the end for the dormant series.
3. Punch-Out!!: While a new Punch-Out!! game is not necessarily expected from Nintendo, it is surprising that the series has been skipped over on the Switch. The Wii had a Punch-Out!! installment, but the Switch has not had any kind of throwback port or new game. The Switch Lite's lack of motion controls may have contributed to the decision not to release a Punch-Out!! game on the Switch.
4. Rhythm Heaven: The bizarre rhythm game series has a long history on Nintendo systems, but it has yet to appear on the Switch. The series may have been lost in the transition from separate handheld and home console markets to a unified system. Games like Pushmo, which were specifically designed for on-the-go play, have disappeared on Switch as Nintendo turned console-quality games into portable experiences.
5. Kid Icarus: Kid Icarus was not considered a major Nintendo franchise for a long time, but the release of Kid Icarus Uprising on the Nintendo 3DS brought the series back into the spotlight.

2024 could be an exciting year for Nintendo fans, as there are rumors that the successor to the Nintendo Switch may be released by the end of the year. While there has been no official confirmation from Nintendo, there are several reasons to believe that this could be the case. One reason is that the current lineup of Switch games for 2024 is looking thin, which may indicate that developers are working on games for the Switch 2 instead.

As we reflect on the Switch's wildly successful life span, it's clear that it has given Nintendo fans a bounty of games to enjoy. While Mario and Zelda games are certainly a highlight, Nintendo has also represented most of its other franchises in some form on the system. However, there are still a few holes in the library, with some key Nintendo franchises yet to grace the system. Here are some of the biggest Nintendo series that could miss the Switch unless a last-second release is on the horizon.

Star Fox is one of the most surprising omissions from the Switch library. The space shooter has been a staple of Nintendo consoles since 1993, appearing on almost every system except for the Wii. The Wii U's Star Fox Zero was a commercial failure, which may have left Nintendo with cold feet. However, the Switch's massive install base means that an improved Star Fox Zero rerelease could have rehabilitated the series.

Earthbound's absence on a modern Nintendo system is also notable. Fans have been begging for a port of the third entry, Mother 3, for years. This year marks the series' 30th anniversary, and some vague events are planned to celebrate it. While games aren't mentioned on the anniversary webpage, there is still a sliver of hope that we might see Earthbound on the Switch in some form this year.

Punch-Out!! is another series that has yet to appear on the Switch. While it may be a niche series, it's still surprising that Nintendo opted to skip it entirely on the system. The series' Wii installment could have been a logical next step for the Switch, but it never happened.

Rhythm Heaven is another niche series that has a long history on Nintendo systems, but it has yet to appear on the Switch. The bizarre rhythm game series has appeared on the Game Boy Advance",large,False

2024 could be an exciting year for Nintendo fans, as there are rumors that the successor to the Nintendo Switch may be released by the end of the year. While Nintendo has not yet confirmed these rumors, there are several reasons to believe that it could happen. The current lineup of Switch games for 2024 is looking thin, which could mean that developers are already working on games for the Switch's successor.

As we look back on the Switch's wildly successful life span, it's clear that the system has given Nintendo fans a bounty of games to enjoy. While we've seen many of Nintendo's major franchises represented on the system, there are still a few notable absences. Here are some of the biggest Nintendo series that could miss the Switch unless a last-second release is on the horizon.

Star Fox - Despite the extensive library of games on the Switch, the Star Fox series is conspicuously absent. This space shooter has been a staple of Nintendo consoles since 1993, appearing on almost every system since the Super Nintendo. However, the Wii U's Star Fox Zero was a commercial failure, which may have left Nintendo hesitant to release another game in the series on the Switch.

Earthbound - The absence of the Earthbound series on the Switch is becoming something of a meme at this point. While players aren't necessarily clamoring for a new entry in the niche RPG series, they have been begging for a port of Mother 3, the third entry in the series. However, despite some vague events planned to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary, there's still no sign of Mother 3 on the Switch.

Punch-Out!! - While Punch-Out!! may not be as highly anticipated as some other Nintendo franchises, it's still surprising that the series has yet to appear on the Switch. Nintendo showed its willingness to make a motion-controller boxing game early in the Switch's life with Arms, but we never got a Punch-Out!! game.

Rhythm Heaven - The Rhythm Heaven series is another niche franchise that has a long history on Nintendo systems, appearing on the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, 3DS, and Wii. However, it has yet to make an appearance on the Switch.

1. Star Fox: Despite the commercial failure of Star Fox Zero on the Wii U, the Switch's large install base could have allowed for an improved rerelease of the game. With potentially only months left in the Switch's lifespan, a last-second release of a new Star Fox game is still possible.
2. Earthbound: The absence of Earthbound on modern Nintendo systems has become a meme, with fans clamoring for a port of Mother 3. While there are no concrete plans for a release this year, the series' 30th anniversary may bring some hope for a revival.
3. Punch-Out!!: Although not expected, the absence of Punch-Out!! on the Switch is surprising. Nintendo's focus on traditional button controls for the Switch Lite may have contributed to this decision.
4. Rhythm Heaven: The rhythm game series has a long history on Nintendo systems, but it has yet to appear on the Switch. Its niche status and the lack of space in Nintendo's first-party schedule may have contributed to its absence.
5. Kid Icarus: After the success of Kid Icarus Uprising on the 3DS, fans have been hoping for a new entry in the series on the Switch. However, it may be more likely for a new Kid Icarus game to appear on Nintendo's next system as a way to showcase new technology.
6. Dr. Mario: Although the puzzle series has appeared on the Switch Online NES app, there has been no dedicated release on the Switch. The mobile game Dr. Mario World may have replaced the need for a new entry on the Switch.",large,False

Another notable absence is Earthbound, a niche RPG series that has a long history on Nintendo systems. While Earthbound Beginnings was released on the Switch in 2015, the third entry in the series, Mother 3, has yet to make an appearance. This is despite the fact that 2024 marks the series' 30th anniversary, and some vague events are planned to celebrate it. However, if the year goes by without Mother 3 launching on Switch, we may be looking at the true end for the dormant series.

Other notable absences on the Switch include Punch-Out!!, Rhythm Heaven, Kid Icarus, and Dr. Mario.

1. Star Fox: Despite its popularity and appearance on almost every Nintendo system since the Super Nintendo, Star Fox has yet to make an appearance on the Switch. The Wii U's Star Fox Zero was a commercial failure, but the Switch's massive install base could have given the series a second chance.
2. Earthbound: The absence of Earthbound on a modern Nintendo system is a meme at this point. Fans have been begging for a port of Mother 3, the third entry in the series, but Nintendo has yet to deliver. This year marks the series' 30th anniversary, so there's still hope for a revival.
3. Punch-Out!!: While not a major franchise, Punch-Out!! has yet to appear on the Switch. Nintendo's focus on traditional button controls for the Switch Lite may have played a role in the series' absence.
4. Rhythm Heaven: The bizarre rhythm game series has a long history on Nintendo systems, but it has yet to appear on the Switch. The series may have been lost in Nintendo's transition from separate handheld and home console markets to a unified system.
5. Kid Icarus: The series was hardly considered a ""Nintendo franchise"" until Kid Icarus Uprising was released on the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. The cult hit game left fans hungry for more, but it's been over a decade since its release.
6. Dr. Mario: The puzzle series has been absent on Switch outside of its appearance on the Switch Online NES app. Nintendo's focus on console-caliber titles and the release of Dr. Mario World on mobile may have played a role in the series' absence.",large,False

2024 could be an exciting year for Nintendo fans, as there are rumors that the successor to the Nintendo Switch may be released by the end of the year. While there has been no official word from Nintendo yet, there are several reasons to believe that this could be the case. The current lineup of Switch games for 2024 is looking thin, which could mean that developers are already working on games for the Switch's successor.

As we reflect on the Switch's wildly successful life span, it's clear that the system has given Nintendo fans a bounty of games. While franchises like Mario and Zelda have been well-represented, most of Nintendo's franchises have been represented in some form, even if some were just rereleases or oddball spinoffs. However, there are still a few holes in the Switch's library, as some key Nintendo franchises have yet to grace the system.

One of the most surprising omissions is Star Fox, a space shooter that has been a staple of Nintendo consoles since 1993. The series has appeared on almost every Nintendo system since the Super Nintendo, only missing the Nintendo Wii. However, it seems like we won't get a Star Fox game on the Switch, which is a shame because the system's massive install base could have elevated even the most niche franchises.

Another surprising omission is Earthbound, a niche RPG series that has been absent on modern Nintendo systems. Fans have been begging for a port of its third entry, Mother 3, but Nintendo has yet to deliver. This year marks the series' 30th anniversary, and some vague events are planned to celebrate it, including merch drops and collaborations. While games aren't mentioned on the anniversary webpage, there is still a sliver of hope that we might see Earthbound on the Switch in some form this year.

Punch-Out!! is another series that has been absent on the Switch, which is surprising considering Nintendo's eagerness to make a motion-controller boxing game early in the system's life with Arms. However, the Switch Lite's lack of motion controls may have made it difficult to release a Punch-Out!! game on the system.

2024 could be an exciting year for Nintendo fans, as there are rumors that the successor to the Nintendo Switch may be released by the end of the year. While Nintendo has not yet officially confirmed these rumors, there are several reasons to believe they could be true. One indication is that the current lineup of Switch games for 2024 is looking thin, which may suggest that developers are already working on games for the next console.

As we reflect on the Switch's wildly successful life span, it's clear that Nintendo has given fans a bounty of games to enjoy. While Mario and Zelda games are certainly a highlight, Nintendo has also represented most of its other franchises in some form, even if some were just rereleases or oddball spinoffs. However, there are still a few holes in the Switch's library, with some key Nintendo franchises yet to grace the system. Here are some of the biggest Nintendo series that could miss the Switch unless a last-second release is on the horizon.

Star Fox is one of the most surprising omissions from the Switch's library. The space shooter has been a staple of Nintendo consoles since 1993, appearing on almost every Nintendo system since the Super Nintendo. However, it seems like we won't get a Star Fox game on the Switch, which is surprising given the system's massive install base and the success of other niche franchises on the platform.

Earthbound is another series that has yet to appear on the Switch, which is disappointing given the success of other retro games on the platform. While Earthbound Beginnings was released on the Switch in 2015, there has been no word on a port of Earthbound's third entry, Mother 3. This year marks the series' 30th anniversary, so there is still hope that we may see a revival of some sort on the Switch.

Punch-Out!! is another series that has been absent on the Switch, which is surprising given Nintendo's eagerness to make motion-controller boxing games early in the system's life. While there may not be a lot of space left in Nintendo's first-party schedule for a quick rhythm game, it would be great to see a new Punch-Out!! game or a throwback port of its Wii installment.

1. Star Fox: Despite its popularity and appearance on almost every Nintendo system since the Super Nintendo, Star Fox has yet to make an appearance on the Switch. The failure of Star Fox Zero on the Wii U may have left Nintendo hesitant to release a new Star Fox game on the Switch. However, with the Switch's large install base, an improved rerelease of Star Fox Zero could have been a success.
2. Earthbound: Earthbound's absence on modern Nintendo systems has become a meme, with fans clamoring for a port of Mother 3. The series' 30th anniversary is this year, and while there are plans for merch drops and collaborations, there is no mention of games. If Mother 3 does not launch on Switch this year, it may signal the end of the dormant series.
3. Punch-Out!!: Punch-Out!! has yet to make an appearance on the Switch, despite the success of Arms early in the console's life. The Switch Lite's lack of motion controls may have been a factor in the absence of Punch-Out!!, as the series relies heavily on motion controls.
4. Rhythm Heaven: Rhythm Heaven has a long history on Nintendo systems, but has yet to appear on the Switch. The series' niche status and the Switch's focus on console-quality games may have contributed to its absence.
5. Kid Icarus: Kid Icarus was not considered a major Nintendo franchise until the release of Kid Icarus Uprising on the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. The game's success and cult following have left fans hoping for a new installment on the Switch, but it has yet to materialize.
6. Dr. Mario: Dr. Mario has been absent on the Switch outside of its appearance on the Switch Online NES app. The failure of Dr. Mario World on mobile may have contributed to the absence of a new Dr. Mario game on the Switch. However, the series' arcade-style gameplay and portable nature make it a perfect fit for the Switch.",large,False

1. Star Fox: Despite its popularity and appearance on almost every Nintendo system since the Super Nintendo, Star Fox has yet to make an appearance on the Switch. The failure of Star Fox Zero on the Wii U may have caused Nintendo to hesitate, but the success of the Switch could have allowed for a revival of the series.
2. Earthbound: The absence of Earthbound on modern Nintendo systems is a meme at this point, with fans clamoring for a port of Mother 3. With the series' 30th anniversary coming up, there is still hope for a revival, but if it doesn't happen on the Switch, it may be the end for the dormant series.
3. Punch-Out!!: Although a new Punch-Out!! game is not expected, it is surprising that Nintendo opted to skip the series entirely on Switch. The Wii U's motion-controlled games were dropped on Switch, which may explain why we never got a Punch-Out!! game.
4. Rhythm Heaven: The bizarre rhythm game series has a long history on Nintendo systems, but it has yet to appear on the Switch. It is an awkward franchise that was lost in Nintendo's transition from separate handheld and home console markets to a unified system.
5. Kid Icarus: Although Kid Icarus was not considered a ""Nintendo franchise"" for a long time, the success of Kid Icarus Uprising on the Nintendo 3DS left fans hungry for more. It is unclear if a new Switch title would have made Kid Icarus a top-tier series, but it would have been its best shot.
6. Dr. Mario: Although tons of Mario spinoffs have made their way to Switch, Dr. Mario has been absent outside of its appearance on the Switch Online NES app. The failure of Dr. Mario World on mobile may have caused Nintendo to hesitate, but a new Dr. Mario game would be a blast for fans of the puzzle genre.",large,False
